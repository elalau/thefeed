                <p>i have several alarms because i am always taking naps. here, i set multiple alarms so that i'm out of bed by at least 7:45am to get ready for my 9am classes. i like to take my time in the morning by making some coffee, doing my skincare routine, doing my hair, and then eating breakfast</p>

               <p>i am a lover of spotify, especially in the morning. as i'm getting ready to go to my class, i like to play my daily drive playlist that includes a mix of music, news, and fun little podcasts. it really gets my brain going and ready for the day!</p>

               <p>after living in san francisco for about two and a half years, i've come to really like transit. apple maps has not been really cutting it this past year, but transit is always accurate in terms of when my bus arrives in the morning. i always catch the 7, get off at haight street, and then walk up to campus. </p>

               <p>i have yet to find an app that organizes all of my tasks! however, i really like to use my reminders app to create quick reminders and also to log in my hours for my on campus job (i seriously need to start putting in the dates as well). </p>

               <p>real adulting is checking your email during your free time i fear. i love that i can just open my gmail app and send quick emails. i also get my canva updates, which is nice for when i don't have my laptop on me. </p>

               <p>twenty fourty eight will have me in a chokehold for the rest of my life. i absolutely adore this game, and i find it very relaxing when im taking a break from doing projects. my secret strategy is to keep the large numbers in the corner. that way, it keeps everything organized. i still have yet to get 4096.</p>

               <p>i am sadly a true consumer at heart in this capitalist society. it's so bad, i think i get spending withdrawals sometimes, i know, I KNOW. anyways, i have been getting back into depop. i haven't bought anything yet because people are selling their second hand items for ridiculously high prices!!! but, i'm really looking for the perfect brown leather jacket for this fall semester and i believe depop is the keeper to my fortune.</p>

               <p>again with the shopping?? yes, this is my confession of being a shopaholic. HOWEVER, facebook marketplace just has really great finds and amazing deals. i love how unique the items can be, and how i can go pick it up and also discover a new area in the city. i'm currently looking for the perfect coffee table. i have one, but it just feels too bulky in my room so i'd like to replace it. </p>

               <p>if there's any app that i supconsciously open, it's instagram. the app has been in my life since middle school for crying out loud. i feel, instagram is going to make a slow decline soon though. my feed is always full of ads and celebrities. someone needs to tell the higher-ups at instagram headquarters that the people just want to see their friends and family's posts!!! thus, i usually just watch people's stories because it's a more accurate depiction of what's going on in my friend's lives. look at how cute my friends cat is AAAA.</p>

               <p>pinterest is my holy grail and i am not afraid to admit it!! i absolutely adore creating albums with all of these lovely pictures i find. right now, i'm trying to find inspiration for my room because she needs a major makeover! i'm trying to go for something warm, with lots of plants, and cool lamps.</p>

               <p>another reason i love pinterest, is because of how easy it is to find ideas that are similar to mine. right now, i'm creating a logo for my cousin's mobile bar, and pinterest has been my main source of inspiration. i plan on creating her logo similar to this logo, but with a cocktail glass instead.</p>

               <p>bereal is actually so fun to use once you don't care about posting on time. i always get hate for not posting on time because im "being fake" LOL. however, i think that can take away from the casualness and realness of the app. i've mostly been using it as a place to store memories because i like that it takes a photo of your scenery and then a selfie.</p>
